# From feedback
* customizing look and feel with themes
* Different kinds of sorting (by application (Issue #3), by some smart heuristics (Issue #5))
* Icons different size from font (Issue #3)
* Optionally darken screen / some similar effect when showing the switcher
* Optionally search by non-localized name too

# Bugs

# Otherwise
* highlighting the matched parts in the texts
* Activating with double modifier key (shift, alt, ctrl) if at all possible with JS only
* Explicit visual cancel and enter buttons
